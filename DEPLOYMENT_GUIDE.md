# CPA Study Agent - Deployment Guide

## Issues Fixed

The following improvements have been made to resolve PDF ingestion issues on Hugging Face Spaces:

### 1. **Missing Dependencies**
- Added `sentence-transformers==2.2.2` for embeddings
- Added `tqdm==4.66.1` for progress tracking
- Added `torch==2.0.1` for PyTorch backend
- Updated `openai==1.6.1` for latest API compatibility

### 2. **Memory Optimization**
- Reduced batch sizes from 10 to 5 chunks per batch
- Added garbage collection (`gc.collect()`) between batches
- Implemented smaller chunk sizes (500 characters max)
- Added delays between processing to prevent memory overflow

### 3. **Error Handling**
- Added comprehensive try-catch blocks
- Better error messages and logging
- Graceful handling of missing files or corrupted PDFs

### 4. **Path Handling**
- Fixed inconsistent path handling between local and Hugging Face Spaces
- Added fallback paths for different folder structures

## Testing Before Deployment

### Step 1: Run Local Tests
```bash
cd cpa_study_agent
python test_ingestion.py
```

This will test:
- ✅ All required packages are installed
- ✅ PDF files are found in correct locations
- ✅ ChromaDB can be set up and used
- ✅ Embedding model can load and generate embeddings
- ✅ PDF processing works correctly

### Step 2: Test PDF Ingestion Locally
```bash
cd cpa_study_agent
python app/ingestion/pdf_ingest.py
```

This will:
- Process all PDF files in the `textbooks/` folder
- Show progress for each file
- Display final chunk counts
- Save to local ChromaDB

### Step 3: Test the Full Application
```bash
cd cpa_study_agent
python gradio_app.py
```

Then:
1. Open the application in your browser
2. Go to "Document Management" tab
3. Click "Check Status" to see current state
4. Click "Ingest Documents" to test ingestion
5. Try asking questions to test retrieval

## Deployment to Hugging Face Spaces

### Step 1: Prepare Your Repository
1. Make sure all files are committed to your GitHub repository
2. Ensure your `requirements.txt` is up to date
3. Verify your `app.json` has the correct configuration

### Step 2: Set Environment Variables
In your Hugging Face Space settings, make sure you have:
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your OpenAI API key

### Step 3: Deploy
1. Push your changes to GitHub
2. Hugging Face Spaces will automatically rebuild
3. Monitor the build logs for any errors

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue: "0 chunks ingested from 12 PDF files"
**Causes:**
- Memory constraints on Hugging Face Spaces
- Missing dependencies
- PDF processing errors
- ChromaDB persistence issues

**Solutions:**
1. Check the build logs for error messages
2. Ensure all dependencies are in `requirements.txt`
3. Try with fewer PDF files first
4. Check if PDFs are corrupted or password-protected

### Issue: Process Never Stops
**Causes:**
- Memory overflow causing hanging
- Infinite loops in processing
- Network timeouts

**Solutions:**
1. The improved script has better memory management
2. Added timeouts and error handling
3. Smaller batch sizes prevent memory issues

### Issue: ChromaDB Errors
**Causes:**
- Permission issues on Hugging Face Spaces
- Disk space limitations
- Corrupted database files

**Solutions:**
1. Clear database and restart: Use "Clear Database" button
2. Check disk space in Hugging Face Spaces
3. Ensure proper file permissions

## Monitoring Deployment

### Check Build Logs
1. Go to your Hugging Face Space
2. Click on "Settings" → "Build logs"
3. Look for any error messages during build

### Check Runtime Logs
1. In your Space, go to "Settings" → "Logs"
2. Look for application errors or warnings
3. Monitor memory usage and performance

### Test Functionality
1. Try the "Check Status" button first
2. Test with a single small PDF file
3. Gradually add more files if successful

## Performance Tips

### For Large PDF Collections
1. Process files in smaller batches
2. Use smaller chunk sizes (already implemented)
3. Consider using a smaller embedding model
4. Monitor memory usage during processing

### For Better Response Times
1. Keep chunk sizes reasonable (500 chars max)
2. Use appropriate batch sizes for ChromaDB
3. Implement caching if needed

## Support

If you continue to experience issues:

1. **Check the logs**: Both build and runtime logs contain valuable debugging information
2. **Test locally first**: Always test with `test_ingestion.py` before deploying
3. **Start small**: Test with 1-2 PDF files before processing your entire collection
4. **Monitor resources**: Hugging Face Spaces has memory and CPU limitations

The improved ingestion script should now work reliably on Hugging Face Spaces with better error handling, memory management, and progress tracking.
